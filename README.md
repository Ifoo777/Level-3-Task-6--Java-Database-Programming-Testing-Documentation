# L# Level 3 Task 5 -Java Database Programming, Testing & Documentation

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Ensure that your environment is set up and you have followed all the steps outlined in this task.

● Using the MySQL client:

○ Insert the following 3 new rows into the java_programming table:

id, name, grade

55, Carl Davis, 61

66, Dennis Fredrickson, 88

77, Jane Richards 78

○ Select all records with a grade between 60 and 80.

○ Change Carl Davis’s grade to 65.

○ Delete Dennis Fredrickson’s row.

○ Change the grade of all people with an id greater than 55 to 80.

● After executing each instruction given above, take a screenshot of your console and send it to your mentor. Number your screenshots 1 to 5 in order of execution.

● Modify the Java program UpdateTest.java to set the qty for Introduction to Java to 0.

● Modify the Java program as follows: InsertTest.java to delete all books with id > 8000; and insert: (8001, 'Java ABC', 'Kevin Jones', 3) and (8002, 'Java XYZ', 'Kevin Jones', 5);

● Test and debug your code.

● Include comments to explain complex sections of code and provide a rationale for the coding method used.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. Use the comment functionality to document what you have done making the code easily understandable to anyone reading your program. The program should allow the clerk to:

○ enter new books into the database

○ update book information

○ delete books from the database

○ search the database to find a specific book.

● Create a database called ebookstore and a table called books. The table should have the following structure (note that the id field is the primary key):

id, Title, Author, Qty

3001, A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens, 30

3002, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, J.K. Rowling, 40

3003, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, C. S. Lewis, 25

3004, The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R Tolkien, 37

3005, Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll, 12

● Populate the table with the above values. You can also add your own values if you wish.

● The program should present the user with the following menu:

1. Enter book

2. Update book

3. Delete book

4. Search books

0. Exit

The program should perform the function that the user selects. The implementation of these functions is left up to you.

● Include comments to explain complex sections of code and provide a rationale for the coding method used.

● Test and debug your code.

● Feel free to add more functionality and complexity to the program.
